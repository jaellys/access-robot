###Arduino Uno (or generic ATmega328P board) w/ cable
- This is the brains of the robot. The arduino is a bare-bones, palm-sized computer that tells the robot what to do and how to do it.
- The Arduino is open source. This means that the recipe for how to make it is available free to the public. Because of this, you can substitute any generic ATmega328P board (as long as it is described as comparable to the Arduino Uno).
- In addition to running Mozi, the Arduino can be used for a ton of other neat projects: https://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-arduino

###Bread board and jumper wires
- Bread boards are like circuit boards that can be rearranged for different projects. 
- Combined with jumper cables, the bread board allows you to create different pathways for electricity to follow as it flows from a + (5V or 3.3V) pin to the - (ground) pin. The Arduino opens and closes these pathways to make Mozi move around and light up.
- It's important to follow the wiring diagram carefully when you're setting up your breadboard. If things are connected the wrong way it could cause a 'short circuit', which means that the electricity is taking a shortcut from it's intended pathway. The current flowing through the Arduino isn't strong enough to shock you, but it could fry Mozi!

###Mini servos
- Servos are a type of motor that can be controlled very precisely. Mozi uses a pair of servos to move forward and backward and to turn.
- There are two types of servos available: standard servos (can only turn 180) and continuous rotation servos (can turn a full 360). Mozi uses the continuous rotation type, although standard servos can be 'hacked' to rotate continuously: https://learn.adafruit.com/modifying-servos-for-continuous-rotation/overview

### Battery Pack
- How Mozi gets power!
- Make sure the battery pack fits at least 4 AA batteries and comes with an Arduino compatible plug.

### USB OTG cable
- This cable is used to transmit code from your phone to Mozi. It is especially important when setting up Mozi for the first time.
