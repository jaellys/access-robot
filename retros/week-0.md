# Access Robot Weekly Retro

## Week 0 - 08/08/2015

### Discussions
- Review of current proposal draft and robot parts list
- Content of wireframes, flows, and user stories (robot assembly, drag and drop for a few commands)
  - Assembly walkthrough
  - Open example project
  - Programming GUI (3-5 commands)
  - Save current project
- Hardware discussion: Arduino vs Raspberry Pi
- Who is the user? Target ages (5 probably lower limit). Being engaging to a child while:
  - 1.) not constraining brand to super young children
  - 2.) being able to interest adults (parent, teacher)

### Concerns
- How to talk to and instruct children (team member-led videos probably best solution)
- Creating a drag and drop interface that works well on a small device (phone), but also scales to larger device (tablet)
- Handling case where a child is "stuck" -- what do we present as a resource?
- Keeping the experience engaging and challenging/rewarding, mitigrating frustration
- Finding child testers!

### Topics of research
- Child learning and development: at what age do kids have the ability to follow instructions, understand language and concepts?
- Interfacing with robot through Android
- Other graphical programming interfaces (Scratch, etc.)

### Plans for the next week
- Reconvene when all robot parts have arrived, play, examine
- Continue research into above topics
