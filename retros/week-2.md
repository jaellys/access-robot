## Weekly Retro Template  

**Goals for last Sprint**:
Development II: Build out programming environment. Wrap code to interface with the robot in graphical language commands. Finalize robot design.

**Goals for this Sprint**:
Development III: Enrich UI/UX. Build robot assembly walkthrough activity. Finalize app.

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well?
    - Ramona wrote a library to convert the Javascript to BitLash! This is great because the Arduino has limited memory, and having more succinct code is incredibly important.
  *  What should we do differently next time?
    - We're doing great, thanks.
  *  What did we learn?
    - Kadeem learned a lot about Javascript and manipulating elements not designed to be manipulated.
  *  What still puzzles us?
    - Maximizing our time.
 
**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?

  *  Jae
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Prototyping UI (Sketch/Framer.js), write method for robot.
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? No. I had to reconfigure due to logo assignment, which became priority.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Customize Blockly appearance, code Blockly tutorial (verify user has completed action), UI polish, sprite icon.
  *  Allison
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Fleshing out basic command list within Blockly, more Arduino reading.
         * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Yes.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: UX flows, settings activity, about page, voice-over for the video, set up Amazon list, structure parts activity, contact Rachel about the camera.
  *  Ramona
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Completing code that must exist on Arduino in order for Blockly to work.
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Yes.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Continue work in Blockly, sprite.
  *  Kadeem
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Fleshing out Blockly code, working with Allison to define basic commands list.
       * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Yes.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Toolbar (sliding in/out), Android -> Javascript, help Jae as needed

**Additional Discussion Topics**:

  *  Compare your work planned with work completed.
    - One or two curveballs, but making really great progress.
  *  Is the divison of roles within your team working? Yes, and everyone is available to help if someone gets overwhelmed.
  *  How is communication and collaboration between team members? Good. There is communication and check-in daily.
  *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code? We've been in touch with mentors, and reviewing code together in class.
  *  How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week? Letting mentors/other members know when we're stuck in order to quickly get unstuck.
