## Weekly Retro Template  

**Goals for last Sprint**:
Submit revised proposal (8/11). Begin experimenting with hardware and writing code to interface Android with hardware. Research programming environments for children.

**Goals for this Sprint**:
Development I: Build Android-Hardware interface. Experiment with programming environment. Prototype graphical language. Experiment with robot design.

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well?
    - We're definitely on track for our sprints. Hardware-wise, the robot has been built and is interfacing with Android via Bluetooth. The programming GUI is coming along, as are the UI and UX. Research and communication have been key during this phase.
  *  What should we do differently next time?
    - We don't think we've encountered things/practices to avoid, but we are aware that for next time we will need to keep adapting/iterating.
  *  What did we learn?
    - Everything. From Arduino to robotics to brain development in children...throughout research and proposal we've learned how to articulate and present ideas, as well as understanding what is feasible within six weeks.
  *  What still puzzles us?
    - The UX aspect of this project is complex.
 
**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?

  *  Jae
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Researching hardware, programming environments for children, and UI/UX, wireframing.
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Yes.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Prototyping UI (Sketch/Framer.js), write method for robot.
  *  Allison
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Familiarizing self with hardware and Blockly library.
         * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Yes.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Fleshing out basic command list within Blockly, more Arduino reading.
  *  Ramona
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Ordering components, designing/building the robot, connecting/communicating with Android via Bluetooth.
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Yes.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Completing code that must exist on Arduino in order for Blockly to work.
  *  Kadeem
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: Get Blockly situated in order to have the foundation/playground for our language.
       * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not? Yes.
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week: Fleshing out Blockly code, working with Allison to define basic commands list.

**Additional Discussion Topics**:

  *  Compare your work planned with work completed.
    - On target and in some cases, we're ahead.
  *  Is the divison of roles within your team working? Yes.
  *  How is communication and collaboration between team members? Good. There is communication and check-in daily.
  *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code? So far we've only reached out to each other for support, but we're trying to arrange meetings with our mentors.
  *  How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week? Just keep killing it.

**Mentor Comments**:  
8/22: Retro notes were sent to mentors 8/17, will be updated when feedback is received.

Kenny: My only note was with Jae about building the robot. That might take too long to implement -- but since Ramona finished building it, it's not a big issue.
