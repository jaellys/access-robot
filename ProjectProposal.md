## The Problem 

Our app aims to provide a low-cost 
Describe the problem that your app will address. This does not need to be a novel idea or product, but your app should not directly recreate an existing product. If you are basing the app on an existing product, there should be some edge to your design or feature that solves a problem with that existing product.

Hardware, in particular, has a high cost of entry. Little Bits,(starter kits $99-199)

The 
In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?

## The Solution 

Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. 
#### Baseline features

 * Low cost (less than $40) diy robot that functions well and looks good.
 * Simple enough for a kid to put together in a weekend. The app includes an assembly walkthrough.
 * Graphical + text-based programming interfaces to control the robot with an Android device. No upper limit for 'hackability'.

#### Bonus features

 * Platform (web based?) for sharing robot patterns + programs

### Wireframe
