# Access Code 2.1 Final Project Proposal (Draft)

**Project Name TBD**  
**Access Robot**  
**Jae Bales, Allison Bojarski, Ramona Harrison, Kadeem Maragh**  

## The Problem 

Our project aims to build an accessible, low-cost experimentation platform for programming and robotics.

Hardware experimentation, in particular, has a high barrier to entry. In the past, few products were available . Recently, Little Bits,(starter kits $99-199). Lego produces robotics kits.


Ultimately, we want our users to gain the learning skills and confidence to 

## The Solution 

The project consists of two parts: hardware (the robot) and software (an Android-based programming environment for controlling the robot).

By building on Android, our platform becomes accessible to the more than 1 billion Android users worldwide, in particular in the emerging markets where cost presents 

#### Baseline features

 * Low cost (less than $40) diy robot that functions well and looks good. Built from open source, easily acquirable components. 
 * Simple enough for a kid to put together in a weekend. The app will include an assembly walkthrough.
 * Both graphical + text-based programming interfaces to control the robot with an Android device. 
 * Designed for learning and growth. No upper limit for 'hackability'.

#### Bonus features

 * Platform (web based?) for sharing robot patterns + programs.
 * Robot add-ons: lights, sensors, internet connectivity.
 * Translation to other spoken languages (e.g. Spanish).
