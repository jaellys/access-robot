# Access Code 2.1 Final Project Proposal (Draft)

**Project Name: TBD**  
**Team Name: Access Robot**  
**Team Members: Jae Bales, Allison Bojarski, Ramona Harrison, Kadeem Maragh**  

## The Problem 

Our project aims to build an accessible, low-cost experimentation platform for programming and robotics.

Software paragraph

tynker.com online programming courses for kids ($50 (single course) - $250 (learning pathway)).

Hardware experimentation, in particular, has a high barrier to entry. 
Little Bits (starter kits $99-199). 
Lego Mindstorm robotics kit ($349.99).
Sphero (smartphone controlled robot $129.99).

User

## The Solution 

The platform consists of two parts: hardware (the robot) and software (an Android-based programming environment for controlling the robot).

By building on Android, our platform becomes accessible to the more than 1 billion Android users worldwide, in particular in the emerging markets where cost presents 

Ultimately, we want our users to gain the learning skills and confidence to engage with the platform, and with technology as a whole, not just as users but as collaborators and creators.

#### Baseline features

 * Low cost (less than $40) diy robot that functions well and looks good. Built from open source, easily acquirable components. 
 * Simple enough for a kid to put together in a weekend. The app will include an assembly walkthrough.
 * Both graphical + text-based programming interfaces to control the robot with an Android device. 
 * Designed for learning and growth. No upper limit for 'hackability'.

#### Bonus features

 * Platform (web based?) for sharing robot patterns + programs.
 * Robot add-ons: lights, sensors, internet connectivity.
 * Translation to other spoken languages (e.g. Spanish).

#### Team Member Responsibilities

Jae:

**UI/UX - Wireframes of screens, storyboards of new user experience, sitemap to show activities that users have access to from each activity, maintaining consistent design feel through the app, working with programming language to decide how the interface is setup.**

Allison:

**Communication between android and arduino/robot - Communication between arduino and android device through serial port, ensuring our programming language commands are properly transferred between hardware, possibly use a translator.**

Ramona:

**Creating a programming language to control the robot's movements - creating scratch like programming language, drag and drop interface on android. Ensuring language is inline with robot's capabilities.**

Kadeem:
