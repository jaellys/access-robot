# Access Code 2.1 Final Project Proposal (Draft)

**Project Name TBD**  
**Access Robot**  
**Jae Bales, Allison Bojarski, Ramona Harrison, Kadeem Maragh**  

## The Problem 

Describe the problem that your app will address. This does not need to be a novel idea or product, but your app should not directly recreate an existing product. If you are basing the app on an existing product, there should be some edge to your design or feature that solves a problem with that existing product.

In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?

## The Solution 

Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I.

 * Assembly tutorial included with app
